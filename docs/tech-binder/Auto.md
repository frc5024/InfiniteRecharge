# Autonomous

Welcome to Autonomous Docs. Here you can find information on how our autonomous works, as well as what it does.

Each autonomos path has been specifically programmed into the robot, and allows it to drive, collect balls, aim, and shoot, all on it's own. Before a match, we will choose which autonomous path to use. The autonomous path will be active for the first 15 seconods of the match, and depending on which path has been chosen for that match, the robot will be able to play on it's own, until the 15 seconds are over. Below is a list of our different autonomous paths, and what they do. 

## Autonomous Paths:

### **Slow Right Path**
- The robot will first pick up 2 of the 3 balls located at the side of the field, then make it's way over toward the goals. It will fire all five balls (The 3 it starts with, plus the 2 that it grabbed) into the high goal.

### **Slow Right Half Field**
- Much like the _"Slow Right Path"_, this path will first pickup the same 2 balls. The Difference is that in this path the robot will turn, and shoot the 5 balls from the trench, instead of driving to the goal.
